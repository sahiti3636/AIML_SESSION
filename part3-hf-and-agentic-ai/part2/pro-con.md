| Very easy access to models via a web UI or simple API calls(eg Gradio) | Spaces are not designed as stable APIs and can break without notice            |
| No need to deploy or host anything yourself                            | Frequent runtime errors (for example expired tokens, cold starts, app crashes) |
| Useful for quick testing, demos, and learning                          | Shared resources (ZeroGPU / CPU) can be slow or unavailable                    |
| Often exposes custom workflows or UIs built by the author              | Limited control over parameters, versions, and backend behavior                |
| Free to use in many cases                                              | No Serrvice level Agreement, no reliability guarantees, and no support if the Space goes down       |
