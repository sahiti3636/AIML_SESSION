| Very fast onboarding with no infrastructure setup               | Not all Hugging Face models are available via inference providers |
| No server management, scaling, or maintenance required          | Limited access to model parameters and advanced customization     |
| Simple, unified API across multiple providers                   | Costs can increase quickly with sustained or high traffic         |
| Pay-per-use pricing with small free credits for experimentation | Higher and less predictable latency than optimized self-hosting   |
| Well suited for prototyping, demos, and low-risk workloads      | Runs on shared systems with limited reliability guarantees        |
